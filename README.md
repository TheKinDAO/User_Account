# User_Account
Each User_Account is implemented as 2 very distinct parts:
1. *legal code*, usually as a secure "public" store of a user's **rank** based on history of completing Work_Contracts counter-balanced by the 'validity' of how that user ranks other users.
2. *source code* usually as a Smart Contracts.
